ID rules for auto-generation of unique Element Ids:

In composing UUIDs the "+" sympbol as in <namespace_uuid> + <context> will be used to create a new
UUID as specified in RFC 4122 for Version 5 UUID.

From RFC 4122 Apendix C

DNS_UUID = "6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8"
URL_UUID = "6ba7b811-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8"
OID_UUID = "6ba7b812-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8"
X500_UUID = "6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8"

MTC_UUID = OID_UUID + "urn:mtconnect.org"

The id for each element will be created by creating the full UUID and then using the characters
as follows:

first_char = [_a-zA-Z]
rest = [_a-zA-Z0-9]

As many bits of the UUID will be utilized to create the id which will be no more than 10 characters.

1. Device_id - Should be supplied from the adapter
   If not supplied by the adapter, UUID will be generated using the followging rule:
      MTC_UUID + Device.uuid

2. Component_id
   Components are hierarchial and have a Element QNAME and an optional "name" attribute.
   The context will be as follows:
       "Component QName" + ["name"] as in <Linear "X">... will be:
   The namespace will be the Parent component UUID (when a device, the device UUID)
       Component_UUID (of parent Component) + context

3. Composition_id
   Similar to the data item, use the following attributes:
       type, name

4. DataItem_id
   The context for the DataItem id is composed of the following attribtues:
       The following will be concatenated: category, type, subType, compositonId, name

       Component_UUID + context


The elements should be processed in the order given above since it follows the dependency
graph.
